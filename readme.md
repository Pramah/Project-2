# Project Title: 
Roaming For Rona
# Project Description: 
The goal of this project is to create an application that informs users in the San Fransisco Area everything they need to know to take precautions against COVID-19. Our users are given the locations of all testing facilities in the SF area in case they wish to get tested for COVID-19, and they are able to track all of their testing history through our application. If tested positve, they can mark places they have been over the past few days as possible areas that may be infected. This information is then shared to all users of our application so they can be informed on possible hot spots in their area. Additional information on up to date global coronavirus data is provided through our application as well so everyone can stay up to date on the status of this pandemic.
